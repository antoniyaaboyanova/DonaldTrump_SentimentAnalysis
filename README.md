# DonaldTrump_SentimentAnalysis
Data set: https://www.kaggle.com/christianlillelund/donald-trumps-rallies 

This is a data set which contains 35 speeches from Donald Trump‘s rallies across the USA. The speeches are provided as txt files in full length.   
Project description: I am curious to see what Donal Trump speaks about. As a start I will apply some pre-processing to the text files. Following this step, 
it would be interesting to provide with descriptive information of his speeches. For example, I will compute the most common words in his speeches, and I am 
interested to find out what names he mentions the most. I would also create Word Clouds to represent the results. The different speeches are in different states, 
so it would be interesting to compare across states and see if there is some underlying similarity (e.g. speeches in Southern states to be more similar than 
speeches in Northern states).  Following this I would be interested in doing some Sentiment Analysis. To do this I will use VADER, TextBlob and 
SentiArt (https://github.com/matinho13/SentiArt) and compare the results. Following it will also be of interest to see how negative the speeches across the different states were.     

Expected Results: I would expect to see that Donald Trump’s speech is polarised and predominantly negative. I would also expect to see how this is 
distributed geographically.
